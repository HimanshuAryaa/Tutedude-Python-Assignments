# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

## Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This assignment contains two tasks focusing on file handling operations and implementing proper exception handling in Python.

---

## 📌 Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Description
A Python program that reads a text file and displays its content line by line, with proper error handling for missing or empty files.

### Features
- Opens and reads a file named `sample.txt`
- Displays file content line by line with line numbers
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` if file doesn't exist
- Handles empty file scenarios with `IndexError`
- Uses `try-except-else` structure for error handling

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python task1.py
```

### Example Output

**If the file exists and has content:**
```
Reading file content:
Line 1: Hello, this is line 1.
Line 2: This is line 2.
Line 3: Python file handling is easy!
```

**If the file does not exist:**
```
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.
```

**If the file is empty:**
```
Error: The file 'sample.txt' is empty.
```

## 📌 Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Description
A Python program that writes user input to a file, appends additional data, and then reads and displays the final content.

### Features
- Takes user input and writes to `output.txt`
- Appends additional user input to the same file
- Reads and displays the complete file content
- Uses append mode (`'a'`) to preserve existing data
- Implements error handling for file operations

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python task2.py
```

### Example Output
```
Enter text to write to the file: Hello, World!
Data successfully written to output.txt

Enter additional text to append: This is additional data.
Data successfully appended.

Final content of output.txt:
Hello, World!
This is additional data.
```

## 💡 Learning Objectives
- File handling in Python (reading, writing, appending)
- Using `with` statement for automatic file closing
- Exception handling with `try-except-else` blocks
- Handling `FileNotFoundError` and `IndexError`
- Understanding file modes: `'r'` (read), `'a'` (append)
- Reading files line by line vs. reading entire file
- String methods: `rstrip()` for removing trailing whitespace

## 📁 Files
- `task1.py` - File reading program with error handling
- `task2.py` - File writing and appending program
- `sample.txt` - Sample input file for Task 1 (you need to create this)
- `output.txt` - Output file generated by Task 2
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## 📝 Note
For Task 1 to work properly, create a `sample.txt` file in the same directory with some sample content, or test the error handling by running without the file.
