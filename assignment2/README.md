# Assignment 2: Control Structures in Python

## Control Structures in Python

This assignment contains two tasks focusing on control structures in Python including conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for loop).

## 📌 Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description
A Python program that takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

### Features
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Uses conditional statements to check even or odd
- Displays the result with the number

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python task1.py
```

### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 7

7 is an odd number.
```

**Another example:**
```
Enter a number: 10

10 is an even number.
```

## 📌 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Description
A Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

### Features
- Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50
- Calculates the cumulative sum of all integers
- Displays the final sum

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python task2.py
```

### Example Output
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
